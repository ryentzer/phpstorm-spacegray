#PHPStorm SpaceGray color theme

This is my attempt to get close to the original Base16 Ocean Dark Colors as seen in the Space Gray theme for Sublime Text.

I've noticed that Java apps tend to lighten and desaturate the colors so I've re-adjusted them to match closer to the original colors.

Original theme by [Chris Kempson](https://github.com/chriskempson).

##Installation
**On OS X**

Copy `Spacegray.icls` into ~/Library/Preferences/WebIde90/colors/ and restart. The settings file is not needed.
